This platform is built using Firebase and React with Vite, which means it's fast, efficient, and secure. I use Firebase's cloud storage and authentication features to securely store and manage photos, and React with Vite to create a seamless and responsive user interface. With the help of face-api's advanced facial recognition technology, the photos are automatically sorted into folders based on the people who appear in them, making it easy to find and view your photos.
